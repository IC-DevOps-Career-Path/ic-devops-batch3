# Git: A Guide to Version Control

Git is a powerful version control system (VCS) that enables teams and individual developers to manage and track changes in their codebase effectively. Originally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, Git has become the most widely used VCS, thanks to its flexibility, performance, and support for both small and large projects.

In this blog, we’ll cover the basics of Git, including what it is, why it’s useful, and how you can get started with some essential commands.

## What is Git?

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. Unlike traditional version control systems that follow a centralized model, Git is distributed. This means that every developer has a complete local copy of the repository, including its entire history, making collaboration faster and more resilient to network issues.
