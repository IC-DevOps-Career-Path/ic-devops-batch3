# Git Commands Documentation

# How do you set up git on your machine?

Two way you can set up git in your machine.

1. Using `git-username` and `password`
   Example: `git config --global user.name "git-username"` | `git config --global user.email "git-email"`
2. Using `ssh-keygen` Setup `setup ssh key in your github account`

# Test authentication `ssh -T git@github.com`

## How to initialize a git repository?

Run `git init` command in your working directory.

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a `.git` folder to start tracking changes. Itâ€™s the first step to set up version control in a project.

# Add changes to git

Run `git add` Command

The `git add` command stages changes in your working directory, preparing them for the next commit. It adds modified or new files to the "staging area," a preview of what will be committed. This is a crucial step before using `git commit`, as only staged changes are included in commits.

# Git commit

The `git commit` command saves staged changes to the repository, creating a new version with a unique commit ID. Each commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point, allowing you to track and manage changes over time.

## See all the commands in table. I have explan with description.

| `git pull origin <branch-name>`              | Fetches and merges changes from the remote branch into the current branch.   |
| `git remote`                                 | Lists all remote repositories linked to the local repository.                |
