TO delete a file in git 
=> rm -rf.git


To git reset 
=> git reset HEAD~1,2,3 //HEAD~1 is used to reset the current HEAD and if we use HEAD~4,5 it will reset from the Head to last 4 or 5 commit that I have made. 

Git reset is 3 types 
1. Soft
2. Mixed by default if we use git reset without mention any command soft or hard git will use mix.
3. Hard

nothing to change just performig git rebase in this stage
